We all need to create our own virtual environment due to file paths, git, etc.

In order to have your own python environment for this project, follow these instructions.

STEPS:

1. Open the Social-Media folder in Visual Studio Code

2. Goto Terminal>New Terminal

3. In the terminal below make sure the directory is something like this (may be different for mac, just make sure your in the social media folder)
    C:\Users\<your name>\Documents\GitHub\Social-Media>

4. Create a python virtual environment
    Copy one of the following into the terminal

    python3 -m venv venv

5. You should have a new folder named "venv", this means you have created your virtual environment, but were not done yet.

6. In visual studio code, if a notification pops up asking if you want to use the new interpreter, click yes.
    -If not, on the bottom left it may say "Select python interpreter" or "Python 3.6", click it and navigate into
        -venv/scripts folder on Windows and select the python file
        -venv/bin folder and select the python file

7. It should show on the bottom left "Python 3.x.x ('venv': venv)"

8. Exit out/ click the trash icon of the terminal window and open a new once

9. The new terminal should have green letters now that says (venv)

10. Finally, copy and paste in 'pip install -r requirements.txt' without the single quotes

11. Install Node.js
